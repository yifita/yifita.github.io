      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;teaser.png&#34; alt=&#34;teaser&#34; /&gt;
We propose a hybrid neural surface representation with implicit
functions and iso-points. The representation leads to accurate and robust
surface reconstruction from imperfect data. The on-the-fly conversion with
efficient iso-points extraction allows us to augment existing optimization
pipelines in a variety of ways. In the first row, geometry-aware regularizers
are incorporated to reconstruct a surface from a noisy point cloud; in the
second row, geometric details are preserved in multi-view reconstruction
via feature-aware sampling; in the last row, iso-points serve as a 3D prior
to improve the topological accuracy of the reconstructed surface&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;overview.png&#34; alt=&#34;overview&#34; /&gt;
We efficiently extract a dense, uniformly distributed set of iso-points as an explicit representation for a neural implicit surface. Since the extraction is fast, iso-points can be integrated back into the optimization as a 3D geometric prior, enhancing the optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
